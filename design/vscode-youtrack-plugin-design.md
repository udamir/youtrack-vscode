# Design Document: VSCode YouTrack Plugin

## 1. Introduction and Business Value

### 1.1 Purpose
The VSCode YouTrack Plugin aims to seamlessly integrate YouTrack issue and knowledge base management into the VSCode development environment. By allowing developers to interact with YouTrack content as markdown files, it significantly improves the workflow between coding and issue/documentation management.

### 1.2 Business Value
- Reduces context switching between VSCode and YouTrack web interface
- Streamlines documentation workflows through familiar markdown editing
- Improves accessibility of knowledge base articles during development
- Enhances productivity by providing search capabilities within the IDE
- Facilitates use of external AI tools with YouTrack content through VSCode

### 1.3 Target Users
- Software developers using VSCode and YouTrack
- Technical writers maintaining YouTrack Knowledge Base
- Project managers and team leads who work with issues and documentation

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality
- Authentication with YouTrack instance via permanent token
- Browse manually added YouTrack projects, their issues, and knowledge base articles
- Open issue descriptions and articles as markdown files in VSCode tabs
- Edit and save issue descriptions and articles back to YouTrack
- Search functionality for issues and articles

### 2.2 Issue Management
- Add and remove YouTrack projects from the Projects panel
- Browse issues for selected projects
- View issue descriptions, comments, and custom fields
- Edit issue descriptions
- Support for issue attachments

### 2.3 Knowledge Base Management
- Browse article hierarchy
- Edit articles with full markdown support
- Create new articles

### 2.4 Search and Navigation
- Full-text search across issues and articles
- Filter by project, tag, status, and other attributes
- Quick navigation between related issues and articles
- History of recently accessed items

## 3. Technical Design

### 3.1 Architecture Overview
The plugin will follow a modular architecture with the following components:
- Authentication Module
- YouTrack API Client (based on youtrack-client)
- Document Manager (handling YouTrack content in VSCode editors)
- Search and Indexing Engine
- VSCode Extension Interface

### 3.2 Integration Points
- VSCode Extension API
- YouTrack REST API (via youtrack-client)

### 3.3 Data Flow
1. User authenticates with YouTrack instance using a permanent token
2. Plugin fetches and caches available projects, issues, and articles
3. User browses or searches for content
4. Selected content is fetched and opened in VSCode's native markdown editor
5. Changes to issue descriptions and articles are tracked and can be saved back to YouTrack

### 3.4 User Interface Components
- YouTrack Explorer view in Activity Bar
- VSCode's native markdown editor for YouTrack content
- Search interface with filtering options
- Context menus for common actions

### 3.5 Authentication and Security
- Secure storage of YouTrack permanent tokens

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Technical Stack
- TypeScript for plugin development
- VSCode Extension API
- youtrack-client for API interactions
- VSCode's built-in markdown preview functionality
- Native VSCode UI components

### 4.3 Development Phases
1. Setup project and implement authentication
2. Implement basic browse and search functionality
3. Integrate with VSCode's native markdown viewing and editing capability
4. Implement save functionality for issue descriptions and articles
5. Implement advanced features and optimizations
6. Testing and quality assurance
7. Documentation and release preparation

### 4.4 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end tests for workflow validation
- Manual testing for UI/UX validation

## 5. Limitations and Constraints

### 5.1 Technical Limitations
- Performance constraints with large YouTrack instances
- Limitations in YouTrack API capabilities
- VSCode extension sandbox restrictions
- Handling of complex formatting and attachments

### 5.2 User Experience Considerations
- Performance of real-time updates and synchronization
- Handling of concurrent edits (by multiple users)

### 5.3 Integration Challenges
- Authentication via permanent token only
- Handling various YouTrack versions and configurations

## 6. Future Enhancements

### 6.1 Potential Future Features
- Support for editing comments and custom fields
- Advanced visualizations (issue boards, timelines)

## 7. Appendices
